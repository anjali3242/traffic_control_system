# 🚦 Smart Traffic Control System (YOLO + LSTM)

## 📘 Overview
This project is an **AI-powered Smart Traffic Control System** designed to optimize traffic signal timing using **real-time vehicle detection**.  
It combines **YOLO (You Only Look Once)** for vehicle counting and an **LSTM model** for predicting traffic flow trends.

The system automatically assigns **green lights** to the direction with the highest vehicle density, reducing congestion and improving traffic efficiency.
